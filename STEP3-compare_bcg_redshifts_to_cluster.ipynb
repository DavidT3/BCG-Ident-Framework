    "The difference between our last use of '.loc', when we were retrieving information for specific clusters (toward the top of this notebook), and how we use it now is very small - we just need to specify that we want to fetch columns, rather than rows. We do this by passing an `axis=1` value to the loc method (in brackets before the square brackets - those round brackets were not necessary when we used loc the first time). In Pandas (and Numpy) the '0' axis is the y axis of a dataframe or array, and the '1' axis is the x-axis.\n",

    "One of the questions you'll be answering in this notebook will require you to use the original cluster redshifts, so you'll need to be able to fetch data from that dataframe as well.

Imagine how confusing it would be if you just retrieved the BCG redshifts from one dataframe, and the original cluster redshifts for another, plotted them against one another, and they didn't look like they were related at all. You might start to question your method, had you even found the right galaxies as BCGs, etc., whereas in reality the clusters were in a different order, so of course the spectroscopic redshifts and the original redshifts weren't related.\n",

    "The most common way of avoiding this ever being a problem is 'matching' or 'merging' - these terms are related to the design and use of databases, and Pandas has convenient methods of merging dataframes - for instance you could tell it that you want to merge two dataframes, based on the column 'name' in each of them, and as part of that merge it would ensure that the rows were in the same order by comparing the 'name' values.\n",

Try to answer the questions posed at the top of this notebook - and as a gentle hint, while looking at tables of raw numbers is very useful sometimes, often the best way of figuring out what is going on for a whole set of data is to make plots. Hopefully you have some matplotlib experience - if not then there should be sufficient resources on the internet to learn how to do this. **Think about what is required for a scientific plot/figure to be useful**.\n",

To add a header, the cell needs to be in 'markdown' mode (controlled by the drop down menu at the top of the notebook, just below 'settings' and 'help'), and you format it as a header by using the # symbol - adding more # symbols makes the header smaller, which can be visually useful for subsection headers.
